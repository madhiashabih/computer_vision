def applyhomography(A, H, output):
    '''
        Uses bilinear interpolation to transform an input image A according to a
        given 3-by-3 projective transformation matrix H.
        
        Notes:
        
        1. This function follows the (x,y) convention for pixel coordinates,
           which differs from the (row,column) convention. The matrix H must be
           set up accordingly.
        
        2. The size of the output is determined automatically, and the output is
           determined automatically, and the output will contain the entire
           transformed image on a white background. This means that the origin of
           the output image may no longer coincide with the top-left pixel. In
           fact, after executing this function, the true origin (0,0) will be
           located at point (1-minx, 1-miny) in the output image (why?).
